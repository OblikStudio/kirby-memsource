"text": "<p>\r\nThe Borrower has asked Nexo (any holding companies, subsidiaries or related entities, all of which are hereinafter referred to as the ‚ÄùLender‚Äù) to grant the Borrower a credit facility in the Nexo Wallet (hereinafter the ‚ÄúWallet‚Äù), in accordance with the following terms and conditions:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>1 Purpose of the credit facility</h4>\r\n<p>\r\n1.1 In connection with the credit facility (hereinafter the ‚ÄùCredit Facility‚Äù) granted hereby, the Lender may, at its discretion, grant to the Borrower one or more overdraft facilities (with a renewal option).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n1.2 To the extent that securities are entered into on the Wallet at the Borrower‚Äôs instruction, the Borrower confirms that the Borrower understands and fully accepts the risks associated with these transactions and that the Borrower is fully aware of the risk of loss (partial or complete) resulting therefrom.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n1.3 It is expressly agreed that the Lender has no obligation to evaluate, monitor or verify the use or the allocation of the borrowed funds.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2 Maximum amount and conditions for granting a credit facility</h4>\r\n<p>\r\n2.1 The total amount of the Credit Facility (including the accrued interest, the current interest, any fees and other amount due in respect of the Credit Facility) shall not, </p>as a general rule, exceed the pledge value (hereinafter the ‚ÄùPledge Value‚Äù, as defined in Article 3.2 below) attributed to all the collateral security (hereinafter the\r\n‚ÄùCollateral Security‚Äù, as defined in article 3.1 below), less the portion of the Pledge Value of the Collateral Security already allocated to other commitments of the Borrower, if applicable.\r\n<p>\r\n2.2 The grant of an overdraft facility requires a request from the Borrower in a form acceptable to the Lender, as well as the Lender‚Äôs prior agreement and the satisfaction of the conditions precedent defined in Article 7 below.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n2.3 If the Lender agrees to grant an overdraft facility to the Borrower, the Lender will provide the Borrower with a transaction advice.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n 2.4 The Borrower may request renewal of a Credit Facility by notifying the Lender at least three business days prior to its maturity date. If the Lender has not received any such notice by that date, the Lender may, at its discretion, renew the Credit Facility for the same term, provided that the required level of security (hereinafter the ‚ÄùRequired Level of Security‚Äù, as defined in Article 3.3 below) is still met and that the conditions precedent defined in Article 7 below are still fulfilled. The Lender shall set the new interest rate in accordance with Article 6 below. If the Lender agrees to renew a Credit Facility or to grant a new one effective as of the maturity date of an existing Credit Facility, no payment related to the amount of the Credit Facility so renewed or refinanced will be requested of any of the parties at that time.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n2.5 Each use of the current account overdraft facility and each fixed¬≠-term advance shall be recorded on the account statements in the Wallet. The account statements shall be considered a confirmation of the amount owed in respect of the Credit Facility and shall constitute conclusive proof that the Borrower has borrowed such amount, unless there is an obvious error.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>3 Collateral security and pledge value</h4>\r\n<p>\r\n3.1 The Credit Facility, as well as any other right of the Lender against the Borrower, shall be secured at all times by the following Collateral Security:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\na) a right of pledge (hereinafter the ‚ÄùPledge‚Äù) on all assets deposited by the Borrower with the Lender in accordance with the pledge agreement entered into separately between the Lender and the Borrower (hereinafter the ‚ÄùPledge Agreement‚Äù);\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nb) any other additional security that may be agreed between the Lender and the Borrower and/or a third party guarantor, or that the Lender may request at its discretion.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n3.2 The Borrower shall at times maintain assets with the Lender that the Lender considers acceptable to constitute the Collateral Security. The Pledge Value attributed by the Lender to each Collateral Security shall be dynamically calculated by the Lender in accordance with the Lender‚Äôs applicable policy at the moment, on the basis of margin percentages applied to the market value of assets that are part of this Collateral Security, which shall be valued at an exchange ratio equivalent to the volume¬≠-weighted average price of the asset, across leading cryptocurrency exchanges, including but not limited to Kraken, GDAX, Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Gemini, and ItBit.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n 3.3 The Pledge Value of the Collateral Security must at all times be sufficient to cover at least one hundred percent (100%) of the following: the total amount owed on the Credit Facility (including accrued interest, current interest, any fees and any other amount owed on the Credit Facility); any other amount that may be owed to the Lender by the Borrower for any reason; and the pledge assets security for any market given transactions (i. e. the Required Level of Security).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>\r\n4 Margin call\r\n</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n4.1. If, in the Lender‚Äôs opinion, the Pledge Value of the Collateral Security is less than the Required Level of Security, the Borrower shall, at the Lender‚Äôs request, furnish additional Collateral Security and/or make the required reimbursements and/or instruct the Lender to liquidate the necessary amount of the Collateral Security.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n4.2. Any breach by the Borrower of the obligation to furnish any additional Collateral Security and/or to make the required reimbursements and/or instruct the Lender to liquidate the necessary amount of the Collateral Security within the deadline, to the satisfaction of the Lender, shall constitute an event of default (hereinafter an ‚ÄùEvent of Default‚Äù, as defined in Article 10 below) and shall permit the Lender to exercise all or part of its rights related to the Collateral Security, in particular those described in Article 5 below.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5 Realisation of collateral security</h4>\r\n<p>\r\n5.1 In the event the Borrower does not restore the Required Level of Security in accordance with the Lender‚Äôs request, or an Event of Default, as defined in Article 10 below occurs, the Lender shall be expressly authorised, but not under the obligation, to realise, all or part of the assets pledged to the Lender by the Borrower or by third parties, in accordance with the Pledge provided for in Article 3.1 above, in the manner and within the deadline that the Lender deems appropriate, and without any obligation to comply with the procedures set forth by the Federal Law on Debt Collection and Bankruptcy or to allocate the proceeds of the realisation net of costs to the reimbursement of the Credit Facility.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n5.2 The Borrower hereby releases the Lender from all liability in connection with such realisation of the assets pledged by the Borrower to cover the Credit Facility.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>6 Interest rate and payment of interest</h4>\r\n<p>\r\n6.1 The annual interest rate applicable to the Credit Facility, as well as any fees related thereto, shall be determined at the time the Credit Facility is granted.\r\n</p>\r\n6.2 The interest rate applicable to overdrafts shall be fixed at the Nexo Prime Rate (hereinafter the ‚ÄùNexo Prime Rate‚Äù), applicable at the time of the use in question (as determined by the Lender at its discretion, on the basis of the market conditions and the Lender‚Äôs financing cost). The Borrower acknowledges that the Nexo Prime Rate may not be less than zero and may vary at any time without notice, in order to reflect a change in market conditions and the Lender‚Äôs financing cost.\r\n<p>\r\n6.3 Interest shall be calculated and debited by the Lender on a periodic basis, as a rule at the end of each calendar day. Interest shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a 360¬≠day year.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n6.4 The Borrower expressly authorises the Lender to automatically debit any due interest from the Wallet without notice. Any shortfall resulting from this debit shall be considered a principal amount borrowed by the Borrower from the Lender under the Credit Facility.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>7 Conditions precedent</h4>\r\n<p>\r\n7.1 The Credit Facility is subject to receipt by the Lender of any document reasonably required by the Lender.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n7.2 The grant or renewal of a overdraft facility shall only be allowed if it does not involve, in the Lender‚Äôs opinion, any illegality, and existing market conditions allow the Lender to obtain the financing necessary to comply with the Borrower‚Äôs request.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>8 Reimbursement</h4>\r\n<p>\r\n8.1 Any amount owed under the Credit Facility must be reimbursed at its maturity date.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n8.2 If, at the reimbursement date of an amount owed in respect of the Credit Facility, the Borrower does not pay any amount whatsoever, whether principal, interest or otherwise, the Lender reserves the right to require the Borrower to pay default interest (both before and after a judgment) beginning on such date and until such amounts are paid, at an annual rate of two percent (2%) above the interest rate, as determined by the Lender in accordance with Article 6, or that would have applied to said amount if it had resulted from use of the Credit Facility.

The Lender shall be entitled to realise all or part of the pledged assets without having to serve formal notice and without having to observe the procedures set forth by the Swiss Federal Law on Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy. The Pledgor shall be deemed to have duly received all notifications sent to the Debtor by the Lender.\r\n</p>\r\nThe relationship between the Lender and the Borrower is governed exclusively by the law of the Lender‚Äôs jurisdiction. Any dispute concerning the relationship between the Lender and the Borrower is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Lender.
